# AuthFireBase
A small test app for learning about firebase authentication.
The application has two forms, one for registering new users and the other for authorizing registered ones. Change of forms is carried out using the button under the form itself. After a hasty registration or authorization, a controller appears with a welcome notification and a logout button.
Implemented checking for empty fields, and error handling from the server. Added Alert controller.

Install pods before use.
